## Introduction

In this repo you will find the code and documentation of the **homework for week 5** of the 
**Encode Club AI and GPT Bootcamp Q3 2024**.

The main goal of this assignment is **to use a Computer Vision model to detect and classify an animal whose picture has been uploaded by the user**.

## Exercise statement

To consolidate the knowledge acquired this week, students should complete the following project:

- [x] Create a GitHub repository for your project
- [x] Add all members of your group as collaborators
- [x] Create a README.md file with the description of your project
- [x] Create a new application from scratch using NextJS
- [x] Create a page with a single input field for the user to upload an image
    - Ideally, the user would upload a picture of an animal 
- [x] Add a button to upload the image
- [ ] Use a Computer Vision model to detect and classify the animal
     - The model should be able to detect at least 10 different animals of your choice
     - The model should return the name of the animal detected (classification)
- [ ] Create an AI Agent that can find a page in [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/) with the name of the animal, retrieve the description, and determine if the animal is dangerous
- [ ] If the uploaded image contains an animal, pass the image to the AI Agent and await the answer
- [ ] Display the answer on the page, indicating whether the animal in the picture is dangerous
- [ ] Submit your project in the submission form

Note: The exercise statement is in the [Weekend Project](https://github.com/Encode-Club-AI-Bootcamp/Generative-AI-Applications/tree/main/Lesson-08#weekend-project) section, at the end of **Lesson 20**.
